Java 8 lambda

        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6);

        //Simple Lambda
        list.forEach(number -> System.out.println(number));

        //Lambda with curly braces
        list.forEach(number -> {
            number = number + 10;
            System.out.println(" The new number is: " + number);
        });

Todo
- BUG whenever the table is deleted (WD) and then we choose a different doctor we get an error because their working day list is a null

SQL statement = SELECT * FROM patients LIMIT 5; (Limits the result set to patients)

Short cuts
SHIFT + ENTER - starts new line
